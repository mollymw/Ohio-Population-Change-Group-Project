# Ohio Population Change Group Project

This group project focuses on Ohio's population change between 2010 and 2020. Within this project, we focused on race and ethnicity demographics and the distribution of populations in metropolitan areas. 

To start this project we make a [project proposal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LCb4qbZAJn_uHSCQLUjne0GhYHoHBHBIdIzj8eL-DPE/edit?usp=sharing) that includes maps made from the inital data sets that we found. We later changed these data sets to ones from the United States Census Bureau. 

We then combined this data from the US Census Bureau with the US Census Burea Tiger shaper file for Ohio (both the 2010 and 2023 versions) to create our [Ohio population data for 2010 and 2020](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-YXEtulCXWJRxuYBSmRGrgSJptjTG4YK?usp=drive_link) data set.

Finally using QGIS and the data set we create we made our final maps and created a story map of our [final project results](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4be2c22255754322ae4083dd33199a8a).
